    "1. Improved control flow: With a program counter, the RPN interpreter can keep track of which line of code it is currently executing, allowing it to control the flow of the program more effectively. This can be particularly useful when implementing control structures like loops and conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Error handling: If an error occurs during execution of an RPN script, the program counter can help identify the line of code where the error occurred, making it easier to diagnose and correct the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Debugging: When debugging an RPN script, the program counter can be used to step through the code line by line, allowing developers to see exactly how the interpreter is interpreting each line of code and identify any issues or bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Optimization: The program counter can also be used to optimize the execution of RPN scripts. For example, if the interpreter encounters a loop, it can use the program counter to jump back to the beginning of the loop, rather than executing the loop code repeatedly.\n",
